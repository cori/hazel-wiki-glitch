Hazel Wiki Starter
==================

This is a quick Glitchy implementation of the Hazel Wiki Node.js wiki engine. Read more about the project [here](http://hazel.wmk.io/), read a detailed "[Getting Started](http://wmk.io/posts/hazel-get-started)", or [fork the project](https://github.com/wkallhof/Hazel) on GitHub.

Hazel is small, only 27 Mb including all of the node modules, so as long as you don't go too crazy you should be able to fit quite a bit of wiki in the remaining 100 Mb that Glitch allows you.

Click `Show` in the header to see your wiki live. Change the initial config by editing config.default.js (you can update your wiki title there, for example). Check oout all of the available [config options](https://github.com/wkallhof/Hazel/blob/master/app/config.default.js). By default your wiki pages / markdown files are stored in `~/node_modules/hazel-wiki/app/content` and your file uploads are stored in `~/node_modules/hazel-wiki/app/uploads`.
